# ToDo
To Do App from Treehouse

The code that I wrote is the the app.js file. How to do the CSS is beyond me at the moment but I did write all of the code in the app.js file 
in addition to the functional programming practice I sent in the emial (which is what I spent a lot of time practicing). 

Can try out the app by opening the index.html file.
